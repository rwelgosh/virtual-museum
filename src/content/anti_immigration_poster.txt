The anti-immigration poster represents the long history of blaming immigrants, especially Asian immigrants, for disease, contamination, and national decline. Care in the Time of Coronavirus emphasizes that this pattern did not begin in 2020. The zine states clearly: “Racialized disease and public health scare are not new phenomena; rather, they are colonial tools embedded into the fabric of this country.”

The pandemic made these old patterns newly visible. Anti-Asian racism resurfaced in the form of slurs, harassment, and physical violence, fueled by politicians who explicitly labeled COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus.” The poster reflects how quickly national fear can turn into racial scapegoating, casting Asian communities once again as foreign, dangerous, and unassimilable.

The zine also highlights how public health crises become excuses to intensify policing, surveillance, and border control. Even outside the U.S., Asian diasporic communities reported facing suspicion and hostility, revealing how the image of the “diseased foreigner” travels globally. As the zine puts it, the pandemic “transformed Asian bodies into sites of anxiety,” a logic with deep roots in exclusion-era rhetoric.

This artifact shows that anti-immigrant messaging does not exist in a vacuum. It is connected to centuries of racial narratives that cast Asian people as threats to national purity. Narratives that reappear whenever the country faces uncertainty, whether economic, political, or medical.
