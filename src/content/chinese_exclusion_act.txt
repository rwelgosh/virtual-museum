The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 emerged after years of fear-driven rhetoric that portrayed Chinese immigration as a national crisis. In 1876, San Francisco lawyer H. N. Clement famously warned a California State Senate committee: “The Chinese are upon us. How can we get rid of them? The Chinese are coming. How can we stop them?” These statements were part of a broader effort to paint Chinese migration as an “unarmed invasion” threatening American society.

At the time, California politicians claimed that Chinese immigration produced severe “social, moral, and political effects” that demanded federal action. Their official address insisted the people of California had “but one disposition… an open and pronounced demand upon the Federal Government for relief.” This pressure ultimately pushed Congress to act.

When the law passed in 1882, it marked a turning point. As Erika Lee notes in her paper ‘The Chinese Are Coming. How Can We Stop Them?’, historians widely describe Chinese Exclusion as a “watershed” because it became the first U.S. law to restrict immigration based on race, nationality, and class. It also led the government to start policing immigrants on a new scale, with them survailing, documenting, and deporting non-white immigrants. The reading emphasizes that exclusion “provided the legal architecture for twentieth-century American immigration policy.” 

Chinese exclusion also helped construct the idea of Asians as inherently foreign and dangerous. The law positioned Chinese immigrants as “the ultimate example of the dangerous, degraded alien”, a racial template used to judge future groups from Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, Mexico, and Asia. As the text explains, many people thought of immigrants as a threat that required Americans to serve as “wardens of the Golden Gate” to protect the nation from a “so-called Chinese invasion.”

The Chinese Exclusion Act therefore did much more than halt immigration. It established a new national identity boundary. One that defined who could enter, who could belong, and who was permanently outside the imagination of the American nation.
