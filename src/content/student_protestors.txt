The student protests at San Francisco State in 1968–69 marked a turning point in Asian American political identity. As ‘Chains of Babylon’ explains, Asian American students rejected the idea that they should quietly assimilate and instead aligned themselves with Black, Latinx, and Indigenous activists to challenge the university’s deeply unequal racial structure. These students formed part of the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF), a multiracial coalition demanding educational access, representation, and control over their own narratives.

The reading describes how Asian American students were inspired to step out of silence and claim a political voice, noting that they joined the strike to oppose the “dominant ideology of assimilation” that erased their histories and experiences. Instead of becoming, in the university’s eyes, “model minorities,” they insisted on solidarity with other oppressed groups. The TWLF offered a new framework of belonging, one in which Asian Americans were not outsiders or passive bystanders, but active members of a global struggle against racism, colonialism, and inequality. As the text emphasizes, the students framed themselves as part of an international movement against the U.S. empire, identifying “Third World peoples… in opposition to first-world institutions.”

The protests also challenged figures like S. I. Hayakawa, the university president who opposed the strike and became a symbol of assimilationist politics. The reading points out that Hayakawa justified suppressing the strike through a defense of “order” and institutional authority, positions that student activists saw as reinforcing the very structures they were fighting. The conflict revealed a generational and ideological divide within Asian America: between those who sought acceptance through conformity and those who demanded justice through solidarity.

By the end of the strike, the TWLF had transformed Asian American political consciousness. The movement helped create the country’s first School of Ethnic Studies and demonstrated that Asian American identity was not simply cultural, it was political.

This artifact represents that moment of awakening. A declaration that Asian Americans would no longer be silent, invisible, or narrowly defined by stereotypes, but instead active participants in shaping their own future.
