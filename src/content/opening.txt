The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 marked a defining moment in U.S. history.  The first time the federal government banned immigration based explicitly on race and nationality. The exclusions, stereotypes, and racial narratives it produced continued to shape how Asian Americans were seen, governed, and treated for generations. This museum traces the ripple effects of the Act across more than a century, from political propaganda and student activism to the murder of Vincent Chin and the resurgence of anti-Asian racism during the COVID-19 pandemic. Each artifact highlights a different chapter in U.S. history, revealing how the Chinese Exclusion Act has continued to impact Asian Americans.

This is an interactive museum. As you move through the space, you can click on each artifact to open a detailed popup explaining its historical context and significance. Feel free to explore in any order. Each pedestal offers a lens into how the legacy of the Chinese Exclusion Act continues to shape Asian American experiences today.
