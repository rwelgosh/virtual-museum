This political cartoon captures the racial anxieties that shaped anti-Chinese sentiment in the late 19th century. As the reading ‘The Chinese Are Coming. How Can We Stop Them’ by Erika Lee says, politicians and commentators portrayed the arrival of Chinese immigrants as a civilizational threat, warning that Chinese culture was “a pagan civilization” that would undermine the social and moral fabric of the United States. Cartoons of the time echoed these ideas, using exaggerated caricatures to suggest that Chinese people were inherently unfit for American life.

Anti-Chinese activists often argued that Chinese migration produced dangerous “social, moral, and political effects” on the West Coast. These claims appeared again and again in political speeches, pamphlets, and newspaper illustrations. Cartoons visually amplified these fears by depicting Chinese immigrants as unclean, immoral, or corrupting forces. These were meant to convince viewers that exclusion was the only way to protect the nation.

The reading also shows how California politicians framed themselves as protectors of America against this supposed threat. In their 1876 address to Congress, they argued that Chinese immigration posed such grave dangers that the public had “but one disposition… an open and pronounced demand upon the Federal Government for relief.” Political cartoons translated this rhetoric into powerful visual messages, making racial fear accessible and persuasive to a mass audience.

Together, these images helped construct the idea that Chinese immigrants were not simply newcomers but a fundamental danger to American civilization. This visual culture shaped public opinion even before 1882 and played a key role in building support for the Chinese Exclusion Act.
