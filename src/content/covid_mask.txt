The COVID-19 pandemic revived long-standing fears about Asian bodies and disease, echoing the logic of exclusion that shaped earlier immigration policies. The ‘Care in the Time of Coronavirus’ zine explains that anti-Asian racism surged as the virus spread, fueled by public figures who branded it with racialized terms. It notes how Trump routinely referred to COVID-19 as “the ‘Chinese virus’”, creating an atmosphere where Asian Americans became targets for blame.

This rhetoric had real consequences. The zine documents a rise in racist harassment, where people suddenly felt “licensed” to treat Asian Americans as threats. One example describes a man who asked a woman in a grocery store whether she had “the ‘Chinese virus’”, using the question to mock and intimidate her. These encounters show how a global health crisis became racialized, reviving the old trope that Asians inherently carry disease.

Asian Americans coped not only with fear of the virus but also with fear of being attacked for wearing masks, coughing, or simply existing in public. The zine recounts how community members created mutual-aid networks, phone trees, and neighborhood watch groups to support one another. It shows that care was not only medical, it was relational, emotional, and political, grounded in the belief that Asian American communities must protect themselves in a society that still sees them as outsiders.

This mask symbolizes the dual burden Asian Americans faced during COVID-19: surviving a public health crisis while navigating the racial targeting that the pandemic reawakened.
